# My-First-Repo

Welcome — this is my first GitHub repository where I'm learning how GitHub works.

## About
This repository is for trying out GitHub: creating and editing files, committing changes, and learning how repositories work.

## What you’ll find here
- A README (this file) that explains the repo.
- Any small notes or experiments as I learn.

## How to edit this repository
1. Click the file you want to change on GitHub.
2. Click the pencil icon to edit it in your browser.
3. Write a commit message and click "Commit changes".

## Next steps I might try
- Add a short description of myself or this project.
- Create a new file with notes about what I'm learning.
- Learn basic Git commands (optional).
